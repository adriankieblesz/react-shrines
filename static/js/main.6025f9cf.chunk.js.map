Those gates symbolise passage from physical earth world\r\n                                to endless world of gods (kami).

Not only shrines but also places like mountais, water\r\n                                and any other related to Shinto beliefs can have Tori Gates.

Then the third son of the emperor which met this\r\n                            experience embodied it into the statue of Daiki-Shinten.\r\n                        </P>\r\n                        <div className=\"toyokawa-grid\">\r\n                            <img src={require(`../images/Toyokawa_Inari_Temple/3c_600.webp`)} alt=\"\" />\r\n                            <img src={require(`../images/Toyokawa_Inari_Temple/2c_600.webp`)} alt=\"\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </ScrollShowElement>\r\n                    <ScrollShowElement classnameshow={\"toyokawa-show-element\"} classnamehide={\"toyokawa-hide-element\"}>\r\n                        <P>\r\n                            That's why you can see here a lot of statues of fox assuming postures as if they\r\n                            cared about bowl of rice underneath, which they actually do.
