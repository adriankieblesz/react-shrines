Those gates symbolise passage from physical earth world\r\n                                to endless world of gods (kami). Actually, those gates are placed as passages in areas\r\n                                where god or gods can be present. Not only shrines but also places like mountais, water\r\n                                and any other related to Shinto beliefs can have Tori Gates. Nonetheless, Hie shrine is\r\n                                one of those places where Tori Gates create wonderful and magic vibes.\r\n                            </P>\r\n                            <img\r\n                                src={require(`../images/Hie_Shrine/12c_800.webp`)}\r\n                                alt=\"hie shrine\"\r\n                            />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </ScrollShowElement>\r\n\r\n                    <div className=\"hie-space\"></div>\r\n\r\n                    <ScrollShowElement classnameshow={\"hie-show-element\"} classnamehide={\"hie-hide-element\"} ratio={1}>\r\n                        <div className=\"hie-grid\">\r\n                            <P>\r\n                                There is also very interesting entrance through one but definitely bigger Tori Gate than\r\n                                previous ones.

Praying and paying here will also help to achieve fortune and may\r\n                            contribute to reach wealthness. Interesting story is connected with this place saying that\r\n                            back to the past to XIII century the descendant of Emperor Juntoku had opportunity to feel\r\n                            spiritual experience where the deity of Dakini-Shinten revealed itself on the top of a fox\r\n                            with a rice plant slung around his back. Then the third son of the emperor which met this\r\n                            experience embodied it into the statue of Daiki-Shinten.\r\n                        </P>\r\n                        <div className=\"toyokawa-grid\">\r\n                            <img src={require(`../images/Toyokawa_Inari_Temple/3c_600.webp`)} alt=\"\" />\r\n                            <img src={require(`../images/Toyokawa_Inari_Temple/2c_600.webp`)} alt=\"\" />\r\n                        </div>\r\n                    </ScrollShowElement>\r\n                    <ScrollShowElement classnameshow={\"toyokawa-show-element\"} classnamehide={\"toyokawa-hide-element\"}>\r\n                        <P>\r\n                            That's why you can see here a lot of statues of fox assuming postures as if they\r\n                            cared about bowl of rice underneath, which they actually do. They are symbols of prosperity\r\n                            and happiness and they have special place in Japanese believes. Because shrine is of course\r\n                            very popular I would highly recommend to visit this place in the morning hours.
